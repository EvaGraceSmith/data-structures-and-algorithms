# Code Challenge - 30

Implement a Hashtable Class with the following methods:

set
Arguments: key, value
Returns: nothing
This method should hash the key, and set the key and value pair in the table, handling collisions as needed.
Should a given key already exist, replace its value from the value argument given to this method.
get
Arguments: key
Returns: Value associated with that key in the table
has
Arguments: key
Returns: Boolean, indicating if the key exists in the table already.
keys
Returns: Collection of keys
hash
Arguments: key
Returns: Index in the collection for that key
