# Understanding Insertion Sort: A Step-by-Step Guide

## Introduction
Sorting algorithms play a crucial role in computer science and data analysis. In this article, we will explore the Insertion Sort algorithm, a simple yet powerful technique for sorting arrays. We will walk through the step-by-step process of the algorithm and provide visual examples for better understanding. Let's dive in!

## Algorithm Overview
The Insertion Sort algorithm constructs a sorted portion of the array by iteratively inserting each element into its correct position. The algorithm follows these steps:

1. Start with an empty array called "sorted."
2. Take the first element from the input array and add it to the sorted array.
3. Iterate over the remaining elements in the input array:
   - Call the "insert" function to insert the current element into the sorted array.
   - The "insert" function finds the correct position to insert the element by comparing it with each element in the sorted array from left to right.
   - Shift the elements in the sorted array to the right to make room for the new element.
   - Insert the new element into the correct position.
4. After iterating through all the elements in the input array, the sorted array will contain all the elements in sorted order.
5. Return the sorted array.

## Example: Insertion Sort in Action
Let's illustrate the step-by-step process of Insertion Sort using an example array: `[8, 4, 23, 42, 16, 15]`.

### Step 1:

We start with an empty sorted array.
`Sorted: []`


## Step 2

We take the first element, 8, from the input array and add it to the sorted array.

`Sorted: [8]`



## Step 3

We iterate over the remaining elements in the input array (4, 23, 42, 16, 15) and call the "insert" function for each element.

Element: 4
Inserting 4 into the correct position in the sorted array `[8]`.

`Sorted: [4, 8]`

Element: 23

Inserting 23 into the correct position in the sorted array `[4, 8]`.

`Sorted: [4, 8, 23]`

Element: 42

Inserting 42 into the correct position in the sorted array `[4, 8, 23]`.

`Sorted: [4, 8, 23, 42]`


Element: 16
Inserting 16 into the correct position in the sorted array `[4, 8, 23, 42]`.

`Sorted: [4, 8, 16, 23, 42]`


Element: 15
Inserting 15 into the correct position in the sorted array `[4, 8, 16, 23, 42]`.

`Sorted: [4, 8, 15, 16, 23, 42]`


## Step 4
After iterating through all the elements in the input array, we obtain the sorted array `[4, 8, 15, 16, 23, 42]`.

## Implementation
Now that we understand the step-by-step process of the Insertion Sort algorithm, let's take a look at a JavaScript implementation:


`function insertionSort(input) {`
  `let sortedArray = [input[0]]; // Initialize the sorted array with the first element`

  `for (let i = 1; i < input.length; i++) {`
    `let value = input[i];`
    `let j = 0;`
    `while (value > sortedArray[j] && j < sortedArray.length) {`
      `j++;`
    `}`
    `sortedArray.splice(j, 0, value);`
    `// Insert the value at the correct position in the sorted array`
  `}`
  `return sortedArray;`
`}`


## Conclusion

Insertion Sort is a simple yet effective sorting algorithm that iteratively builds a sorted portion of the array by inserting each element into its correct position. Although it may not be the most efficient algorithm for large datasets, it performs well for small or nearly sorted arrays. Understanding its step-by-step process allows us to appreciate its simplicity and its usefulness in various scenarios.
