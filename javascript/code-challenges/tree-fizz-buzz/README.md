# Code Challenge - 18 [Tree Fizz Buzz](https://codefellows.github.io/common_curriculum/data_structures_and_algorithms/Code_401/class-18/)


* Write a function called fizz buzz tree
* Arguments: k-ary tree
* Return: new k-ary tree
* Determine whether or not the value of each node is divisible by 3, 5 or both. Create a new tree with the same structure as the original, but the values modified as follows:
* If the value is divisible by 3, replace the value with “Fizz”
* If the value is divisible by 5, replace the value with “Buzz”
* If the value is divisible by 3 and 5, replace the value with “FizzBuzz”
* If the value is not divisible by 3 or 5, simply turn the number into a String.
