**Welcome to the Merge Sort Blog!**

In this article, we'll explore the Merge Sort algorithm, step through its execution using the provided pseudocode, and then implement a working solution in JavaScript. We'll also write test cases using Jest to validate the correctness of our implementation.

**Merge Sort Overview**

Merge Sort is a popular sorting algorithm that follows the divide-and-conquer approach. It works by dividing the input array into smaller subarrays, sorting them recursively, and then merging the sorted subarrays to obtain the final sorted array.

Now, let's dive into the pseudocode provided and understand how Merge Sort works.

**Pseudocode Explanation**

The pseudocode consists of two functions: `Mergesort` and `Merge`. The `Mergesort` function takes an array `arr` and recursively divides it into smaller subarrays until they contain only one element. It then calls the `Merge` function to merge and sort the subarrays. The `Merge` function combines two sorted subarrays into a single sorted array.

Let's walk through the pseudocode step by step using the sample array `[8, 4, 23, 42, 16, 15]`:

1. **Mergesort** is called with the array `[8, 4, 23, 42, 16, 15]`.

2. The length of the array is calculated, which is `6`.

3. Since `n > 1`, the algorithm proceeds to divide the array into two halves.

4. The midpoint `mid` is calculated as `n/2`, which is `3`.

5. Two new arrays, `left` and `right`, are created:
   - `left` contains the elements from index `0` to `mid-1` in the original array. So, `left` becomes `[8, 4, 23]`.
   - `right` contains the elements from index `mid` to `n-1` in the original array. So, `right` becomes `[42, 16, 15]`.

6. **Mergesort** is called recursively on `left`.

   *Recursion Step 1:*
   - The length of `left` is calculated, which is `3`.
   - Since `n > 1`, the algorithm proceeds to divide `left` into two halves.
   - The midpoint `mid` is calculated as `n/2`, which is `1`.
   - Two new arrays, `leftLeft` and `leftRight`, are created:
     - `leftLeft` contains the elements from index `0` to `mid-1` in `left`. So, `leftLeft` becomes `[8]`.
     - `leftRight` contains the elements from index `mid` to `n-1` in `left`. So, `leftRight` becomes `[4, 23]`.
   - **Mergesort** is called recursively on `leftLeft`.
   - The length of `leftLeft` is `1`, so it doesn't need further division.
   - The algorithm moves on to sort `leftRight`.

   *Recursion Step 2:*
   - The length of `leftRight` is `2`.
   - Since `n > 1`, the algorithm proceeds to divide `leftRight` into two halves.
   - The midpoint `mid` is calculated as `n/2`, which is `1`.
   - Two new arrays, `leftRightLeft` and `leftRightRight`, are created:
     - `leftRightLeft` contains the elements from index `0` to `mid-1` in `leftRight`. So, `leftRightLeft` becomes `[4

]`.
     - `leftRightRight` contains the elements from index `mid` to `n-1` in `leftRight`. So, `leftRightRight` becomes `[23]`.
   - **Mergesort** is called recursively on `leftRightLeft` and `leftRightRight`.
   - Both `leftRightLeft` and `leftRightRight` have length `1`, so they don't need further division.

   Now, we have completed sorting the elements of `leftRight`.

7. **Mergesort** is called recursively on `right`.

   This process is similar to what we did for `left`. It divides `right` into subarrays and sorts them recursively.

   *Recursion Step 1:*
   - `right` is divided into `rightLeft` and `rightRight`.
   - `rightLeft` contains `[42]` and `rightRight` contains `[16, 15]`.
   - Both subarrays have length `1`, so they are already sorted.

   Now, we have completed sorting the elements of `right`.

8. Finally, the algorithm calls the `Merge` function to merge the sorted `left` and `right` arrays into the original `arr`.

   The `Merge` function compares the elements from the `left` and `right` arrays, selects the smaller one, and places it in the `arr` array. This process continues until all elements are merged.

   In our example, the `Merge` function merges `[8]` and `[4, 23]` to produce `[4, 8, 23]`. Then, it merges `[42]` and `[16, 15]` to produce `[15, 16, 42]`. Finally, it merges `[4, 8, 23]` and `[15, 16, 42]` to obtain the sorted array `[4, 8, 15, 16, 23, 42]`.

 Merge Sort is a powerful algorithm with a time complexity of O(n log n), making it efficient for sorting large arrays.

Remember to analyze the time and space complexity of any algorithm before using it in your projects. Understanding the inner workings of algorithms and their complexity can greatly contribute to writing efficient code.
